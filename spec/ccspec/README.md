```

CCSpec is a BDD-style testing framework for C++, specifially, C++11. You write
tests (or specs in CCSpec context) using a semi-natural domain-specific language that is
perfectly valid C++ code, effectively making your specs executable
documentation. Ideally, reading the spec code as well as the documentation
output out loud should just sound like speaking English.

CCSpec is derived from RSpec, the BDD testing framework for Ruby. In fact,
CCSpec is simply an attempt to port RSpec from Ruby to C++ as much as possible.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to link the CCSpec library to your test executable(s):
the Biicode way or the regular CMake way.

### Automatic linkage with Biicode

The easiest way to use CCSpec in your project is by using
[Biicode](https://www.biicode.com). Biicode is a C and C++ dependency manager,
resembling RubyGems for Ruby and NPM for Node.js.

If your project already uses Biicode, great! You can skip to the
[Configure Biicode](#configure-biicode)
section.

#### Download and install Biicode

You can follow the official instructions at Biicode's
[installation page](http://docs.biicode.com/c++/installation.html).

Alternatively, you can install Biicode through your native package manager if
Biicode is in the repositories. For example, Arch Linux users maintain a Biicode
package in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/biicode/). For OS X
users, Homebrew Cask also has an
[entry](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/biicode.rb).

#### Adapt your project as a Biicode project

Take a look at Biicode's
[Adapt your library guide](http://docs.biicode.com/c++/adapt_library_guide.html)
for how to use Biicode for your existing project.

```Zsh
cd <your_project_root_directory>
bii init -L
```

#### Configure Biicode

Add the following config to your `biicode.conf` under the root directory of your
project:

```
[requirements]
  zhangsu/ccspec: 0

[includes]
  ccspec/*.h: zhangsu/ccspec/include/
```

the [requirements] section declares to have your project depend on
 `zhangsu/ccspec`, which is the
[official published Biicode block for CCSpec](https://www.biicode.com/zhangsu/ccspec).
The number `0` indicates which CCSpec version to use, and currently there is only
the development version which is `0`. The [includes] section defines a short form
for the include path so that, instead of using the fully-qualified Biicode path:

```C++
#include "zhangsu/ccspec/include/ccspec/*.h"
```

You can just do

```C++
#include "ccspec/*.h"
```

Note that you may still need
[other config sections](http://docs.biicode.com/c++/reference/biicode-conf.html)
in your biicode.conf for your project, but the above two are crucial for using
CCSpec. Most likely you will need a
[\[tests\]](http://docs.biicode.com/c++/reference/biicode-conf.html#tests) section
to specify the CCSpec spec files of your project so that they are not linked to
your project's production libraries or executables:

```
[tests]
  spec/*
```

This specifies that files under the `spec/` directory are test files. To test this,
put a simple spec file under the `spec/` directory:

```C++
#include "ccspec/core.h"
#include "ccspec/expectation.h"
#include "ccspec/matchers.h"

using std::cout;
using std::ostringstream;
using ccspec::core::Reporter;
using ccspec::core::describe;
using ccspec::core::example;
using ccspec::core::formatters::DocumentationFormatter;
using ccspec::matchers::eq;
using ccspec::expect;

auto addition_spec = describe("Addition", [] {
  example("1 + 1 = 2", [] {
    expect(1 + 1).to(eq(2));
  });
});

int main() {
  DocumentationFormatter formatter(cout);
  Reporter reporter(&formatter);
  bool succeeded = addition_spec->run(reporter);
  delete addition_spec;
  return !succeeded;
}
```

At this point, you should be able to run `bii find` to download all the dependencies
including CCSpec.

##### CMake
In your main Biicode CMake file, add

```CMake
IF(APPLE)
  SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++")
ELSEIF (WIN32 OR UNIX)
  SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
ENDIF(APPLE)
```
before your `ADD_BII_TARGETS()` call. This is to turn on C++11 support so that
CCSpec header can actually be compiled.

Then, to test if everything works:
```Zsh
bii build # build your main libraries and executables
bii test  # run your CCSpec specs
```

#### Example project
Here's an [example project](https://github.com/zhangsu/ccspec-example/) that uses
CCSpec to test a simple binary search tree, using Biicode to manage the dependency.

### Linkage with CMake
CCSpec can also be compiled from source and linked to your project through
regular CMake workflow.
```Zsh
git clone git@github.com:zhangsu/ccspec.git
cd ccspec
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then a shared library will be generated under `build/src/`. For example, on Linux
`libccspec.so` is generated. On OS X `libccspec.dylib` is generated. Headers are
under `include/`.

You may also choose to install the headers and library file to your system directory
by running `make install`.

## Detailed Usage

```C++
namespace ccspec;
```

CCSpec defines a domain-specific language (DSL) with a set of tokens. These
tokens are all protected under the `ccspec` namespace. Each section below states
the sub-namespace for the tokens illustrated in the section, such as `describe`,
`it`, `before`, `after`, and `expect`.

### Example groups and examples

```C++
using ccspec::core::context;
using ccspec::core::describe;
using ccspec::core::example;
using ccspec::core::it;
```

CCSpec contains hierarchical structures of *example group*s and *example*s. Each
example group is a collection of descriptions of related behavioral examples.
The `describe` function returns an example group, which can contain multiple
examples specified by the `example`, `specify` or `it`.

```c++
auto arithmetics_spec = describe("elementary school arithmetics", [] {
  example("one plus one equals two", [] {
    expect(1 + 1).to(eq(2));
  });

  specify("three minus four is less than or equal to zero", [] {
    expect(3 - 4).to(be <= 0);
  });
});
```

Note that the above root example group is saved in a global variable
`arithmetics_spec`, which can be referenced later in the `main` function to
be actually executed. You can also write example groups in a function scope, but
then everything needs to be indented by one more level so its less
width-efficient.

In case of describing an object, it is more natural to start the description
with the subject "it". It just reads better.

```c++
class Student {
 public:
  bool hasPapers() const {
    return true;
  }

  string status() const {
    return "alumni";
  }
};

auto student_spec = describe("Student", [] {
  Student subject;

  it("has published papers", [subject] {
    expect(subject.hasPapers()).to(be_truthy);
  });

  it("is alumni", [subject] {
    expect(subject.status()).to(eq("alumni"));
  });
});
```

`example`, `specify` and `it` are all synonymous. They are used in different
contexts to make the specs more readable.

Example groups can be nested as deep as needed to divide the examples into
separate logical groups:

```C++
auto abs_spec = describe("::abs", [] {
  context("with positive argument", [] {
    it("returns the argument itself", [] {
      expect(abs(1)).to(eq(1));
    });
  });

  context("with negative argument", [] {
    it("returns the negation of the argument", [] {
      expect(abs(-1)).to(eq(1));
    });
  });

  context("with 0 as argument", [] {
    it("returns 0", [] {
      expect(abs(0)).to(eq(0));
    });
  });
});
```
Here, `context` is synonymous to `describe`. Again, they are used in different
situations just for readability.

### Hooks

```C++
using ccspec::core::after;
using ccspec::core::around;
using ccspec::core::before;
```

#### Before each and after each hooks

It's also possible to do initialization and cleanup before each test case
similar to the magical 'setup' and 'teardown' functions in traditional unit
testing frameworks. In CCSpec, these are known as *before each* and *after
each* hooks.

```c++
Duck* duck;

auto duck_spec = describe("Duck", [] {
  before("each", [] {
    duck = new Duck();
  });

  after("each", [] {
    delete duck;
  });

  it("quacks", [duck] {
    expect(duck->respondTo('quack')).to(be_truthy);
  });
});
```
In the above snippet, each example (only one example in this case) in the
example group gets an unique instance of `Duck`.

#### Around hooks
Around hooks are hooks that wrap around the execution of each example, so it can
be seen as a mix of both before each and after each hook.

```C++
around("each", [](const Example& example) {
  // Execute anything before executing each example in the enclosing example group.
  bst = new MessageScheduler();

  // Execute the example.
  example.run();

  // Execute anything after executing each example in the enclosing example group.
  delete bst;
});
```

#### Before all and after all hooks

Before all hooks are executed before executing all examples in the enclosing
example group. After all hook is executed after all examples in the enclosing
example group. Unless "each" hooks, they are executed only once per example
group.

```c++
class Student {
 public:
  void setName(string name) {
    this->name = name;
  }

  void setMark(int mark) {
    this->mark = mark;
  }

  string getEvaluation() const {
    if (mark > 90) {
      return name + " is superb!";
    } else if (mark > 80) {
      return name + " is excellent!";
    } else if (mark > 70) {
      return name + " is good!";
    } else if (mark > 60) {
      return name + " is okay.";
    } else {
      return name + " needs improvement";
    }
  }

 private:
  string name;
  int mark;
};

auto student_spec = describe("Student", [] {
  Student* student = new Student();

  before("all", [student] {
    student->setName("Joe");
  });

  describe("with perfect mark", [student] {
    before("each", [student] {
      student->setMark(100);
    });

    it("gets superb evaluation", [student] {
      expect(student->getEvaluation()).to(contain("superb"));
    });
  });

  describe("with failing mark", [student] {
    before("each", [student] {
      student->setMark(49);
    });

    it("gets 'needs improvement' evaluation", [student] {
      expect(student->getEvaluation()).to(contain("needs improvement"));
    });
  });

  after("all", [student] {
    delete student;
  });
});
```
In the above snippet, all the examples share one instance of `Student`.

#### Scope and execution order
Hooks are only executed for examples contained in the example group that
immediately encloses the hooks themselves. This would be useful to do
initialization and cleanup differently for different (nested) example groups.

The execution order of various hooks is:
  1. Before all hooks
  2. Around each hooks (the part before calling Example#run)
  3. Before each hooks
  4. Execution of the example
  5. After each hooks
  6. Around each hooks (the part after calling Example#run)
  7. After all hooks

Before hooks in a parent example group are always executed **before** those
of the same type in the child example group.

After hooks in a parent example group are always executed **after** those of the
same type in the child example group.

Around hooks in a parent example group wrap around around hooks in the child
example group recursively.

Multiple hooks of the same type are allowed within the same example group. They
are executed in the order of declaration.

TODO(zhangsu): add example snippet and output to demonstrate the order.

### Expectations

```C++
using ccspec::expect;
```

Expectations in CCSpec are known as assertions in other frameworks. They are
the construct in each example that makes the example pass or fail.

```
expect(actual_value).to(eq(expected_value));
expect(actual_value).notTo(be_truthy);
```

It is important to note that the **`expect` call must be chained with the `to`
call in one method call expression**, or otherwise the behavior is undefined.

### Matchers

```C++
using ccspec::matchers::be;
using ccspec::matchers::be_falsey;
using ccspec::matchers::be_truthy;
using ccspec::matchers::contain;
using ccspec::matchers::eq;
using ccspec::matchers::match;
```

Matchers are what are passed to the `to(...)` call in an expectation. Below is
a list of built-in matchers in CCSpec:
```C++
// Match object reference (identity).
expect(actual_obj).to(be(expected_obj));
// Match numerical binary relations.
expect(actual_value).to(be < expected_value);
expect(actual_value).to(be <= expected_value);
expect(actual_value).to(be == expected_value);
expect(actual_value).to(be >= expected_value);
expect(actual_value).to(be > expected_value);
expect(actual_value).to(be != expected_value);
// Match falsey values (0, 0.0, 0.0f, false, nullptr)
expect(actual_value).to(be_falsey);
// Match truthy values (anything other than the above)
expect(actual_value).to(be_truthy);
// Match substring.
expect(string).to(contain(substring));
// Match equality.
expect(actual_value).to(eq(expected_value));
// Match using the actual value's `match` method.
expect(actual_value).to(match(expected_value));
```

### Entry point
The [\[Example groups and examples\]](#example-groups-and-examples) section
shows how the root example group can be saved in a global variable. Now we need
to actually execute the example group tree in the `main` function.

To do that, we will need to call the `run` method on the example group. However,
The `run` method needs to know *how* and *where* to report the test execution
progress and results, so we need to pass a reporter object. The reporter object
takes a formatter object which knows *how* to format the test execution output.
Finally, the formatter object takes a `std::ostream&` so that it know *where* to
output to.

```C++
#include "ccspec/core.h"

using ccspec::core::Reporter;
using ccspec::core::formatters::DocumentationFormatter;

auto spec = describe("...", [] {
  // ...
});

int main() {
  DocumentationFormatter formatter(cout);
  Reporter reporter(&formatter);
  bool succeeded = spec->run(reporter);
  delete addition_spec;
  return !succeeded;
}
```

The `run` method returns whether all tests pass, so we can let `main` return the
negation of it to indicate the process exit value so that tools calling the test
executables such as Travis CI know whether the tests pass or not.

#### One `main` or multiple `main`s?
You have two choices when it comes to management of multiple spec files:

##### Have only one `main` function
  In this approach, you write CCSpec specs in many different specs files, and
none of them contain a `main` function. Then, in another file, you write a
`main` function in which you reference and run all the global variables defined
in these spec files. At the end, only one test executable is generated and your
continuous integration tool only needs to execute this one executable. The
[specs for CCSpec itself](spec/) uses this approach.

##### Have one `main` function per spec file
  In this approach, every spec file has a separate `main` function, so each spec
is a separate entry point. Your continuous integration tool needs to execute all
the executables generated from these specs.

### Shared objects between examples

It is often useful to declare a variable in scope of multiple examples (e.g, in
the enclosing example group lambda so that all enclosed examples can see it) and
initialize it and clean it up in before each and after each hooks so that each
example doesn't have to repeat the setup and teardown.

However, unlike other garbage-collected languages, when capturing variables in
the context by reference, C++ lambda functions do not extend the lifetime of the
captured variable. The following CCSpec code will likely generate a segfault:

```C++
describe("Foo", [] {
  Foo foo;

  before("each", [&foo] {
    foo = Foo("bar");  // segfault!
  });
});
```

This is because `describe`'s lambda function is executed at "parse" time, i.e.,
when the example group tree is being constructed, whereas the the before hook
(in fact any kind of hook and also examples) is executed at "run" time, i.e.,
when the `run` method is called on an example group tree. By the time the before
hook is executed, `describe`'s lambda function has already finished execution
and the scope of `foo` is also destroyed. Referencing `foo` in the hook would be
an undefined behavior.

This is also true when you use pointers:

```C++
describe("Foo", [] {
  Foo* foo;

  before("each", [&foo] {
    foo = new Foo();  // segfault!
  });
});
```

#### Solutions
You can extend the lifetime of the object in other ways.

You can put the object in a global variable so that the lifetime of the object
is extended to the lifetime of the process. You also don't have to capture the
variable in this case.

```C++
Foo* foo;

auto foo_spec = describe("Foo", [] {
  before("each", [] {
    foo = new Foo();
  });

  after("each", [] {
    delete foo;
  });

  it("can bar", [] {
    expect(foo->canBar()).to(be_truthy);
  });
});
```

Or, you can allocate the pointer dynamically and capture a copy of the pointer
to the pointer:

```C++
describe("Foo", [] {
  Foo** foo = new Foo*;

  after("all", [foo] {
    delete foo;
  });

  before("each", [foo] {
    *foo = new Foo();
  });

  after("each", [foo] {
    delete *foo;
  });

  it("can bar", [foo] {
    expect((*foo)->canBar()).to(be_truthy);
  });
});
```

Or use a `shared_ptr` so you don't need an after all hook:

```C++
describe("Foo", [] {
  std::shared_ptr<Foo*> foo = std::make_shared<Foo*>();

  before("each", [foo] {
    *foo = new Foo();
  });

  after("each", [foo] {
    delete *foo;
  });

  it("can bar", [foo] {
    expect((*foo)->canBar()).to(be_truthy);
  });
});
```

Or shared the same instance across examples:

```C++
describe("Foo", [] {
  Foo* foo = new Foo();

  after("all", [foo] {
    delete foo;
  });

  it("can bar", [foo] {
    expect(foo->canBar()).to(be_truthy);
  });
});
```

Or use copies everyhwere if you don't care about running the
initialization/cleanup before and after the execution of every example:
```C++
describe("Foo", [] {
  Foo foo("baz");

  it("can bar", [foo] {
    expect(foo.canBar()).to(be_truthy);
  });
});
```
